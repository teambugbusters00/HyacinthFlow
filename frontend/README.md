## ✨ About the Project  

Water hyacinth clogs rivers, destroys biodiversity, and impacts farming communities.  
Instead of seeing it as waste, **Hyacinth Flow** reimagines it as a **resource**:  

- 🌿 Farmers harvest & trade hyacinth in batches (e.g., 100 kg).  
- 🧵 Fibers are processed into sustainable products (mats, handicrafts, textiles).  
- ⚡ Extra biomass is converted into clean biogas with a **70/30 or 80/20 revenue model**.  
- 🛒 An **online marketplace** connects eco-conscious buyers with local artisans.  

The platform is **community-first**, eco-conscious, and designed for **circular economy impact**.
